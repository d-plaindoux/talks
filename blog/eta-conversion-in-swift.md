# &eta;-conversion inconsistency in Swift v3+

**Keywords** Fonctional paradigm, Swift v3+, Langage design, Expressiveness, &lambda;-calculus, &eta;-conversion

In this post we show how &eta;-conversion transformation rule can or cannot be applied in 
Swift v3+ and what's the impact on the design and the expressiveness.

## Foundation

The &lambda;-calculus is a formal system on application and abstraction expressions. A set of 
transformation rules define an equational theory dedicated to the expression manipulation. This 
set contains transformation rules dedicated to the reduction process based on &alpha;-conversion, 
&beta;-reduction and &eta;-conversion. 

The &alpha;-conversion allows bound variable names to be changed, the &beta;-reduction explains
the application in terms of substitution and finally the &eta;-conversion stated &lambda;x.(f x) 
is equivalent to f whenever x does not appear free in f.

## Functional programming in Swift v3+

### Function definition

In Swift a function is defined by a name, a set of named arguments and a returned type. For instance we can
simply define the currified addition with the following function `add`.

```Swift
func add(a: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return { b in a + b }
}
```

Then calling this function in Swift can be easily done but this requires the argument names as shown in 
the following example.

```Swift
add(a:1)(2)
```

Sweet Objective-C legacy!

It's important to notice the difference between a function definition from an anonymous function. In the first
case each argument name is required when such argument name is prohibited when applying a closure. Why this 
difference? Because of function redefinition principle in Swfit.

### Function redefinition 

Each argument name can be defined or simply ignored. This is done adding a new name before the parameter name 
if we want to distinguish the argument name from the parameter name or`_` if we want to ignore this naming 
convention.

Then we can define `add`  without argument name using `_` convention.

```Swift
func add(_ a: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return { b in a + b }
}
```

Then calling this function reflect the argument names convention chosen in the specification i.e. no specific
name.

```Swift
add(1)(2)
```

## Lost in transformation!

Each function previously defined in the same scope has:
- the same name i.e. `add`
- and the same signature i.e. `Int -> Int -> Int`

Therefor only argument names are differents. Based on these definitions what can we do when we want to *deal* with the &eta;-conversion? 

As mentioned in the introduction the &eta;-conversion stated &lambda;x.(f x) &longleftrightarrow;<sub>&eta;</sub> f whenever x does not appear free in f. This can be separated in two transformation rules:
- &eta;-expansion stated f &longrightarrow;<sub>&eta;</sub> &lambda;x.(f x)
- &eta;-reduction stated &lambda;x.(f x) &longrightarrow;<sub>&eta;</sub> f 

### Applying the &eta;-expansion

In Swift the &eta;-expansion is verified since functions can be naturally referenced in the langage.

```Swift
let increment_1 = add(a:1)
let increment_2 = add(1)
```

This can also be expressed applying the &eta;-expansion transformation rule as follow:

```Swift
let increment_1_eta_expanded = { b in add(a:1)(b) }
let increment_2_eta_expanded = { b in add(1)(b)   }
```

As we can see a function expression can replaced naturally by it's expansion.

So far so good!

### Applying the &eta;-reduction

If we have a list of integers we can for instance apply this `add` on each element. 
This can be done calling the `map` function as follow:

```Swift
let l = [1,2].map{ b in add(b) }
```

The mapped function can be simply reduced applying the &eta;-reduction transformation rule.

```Swift
let l_eta_reduced : [(Int -> Int] = [1,2].map(add)
```

This seems quite natural but here we face a little problem. In fact which `add` is applied 
since two definitions exist. So lets try compiling the code and see what's going on! 

```Swift
error: ambiguous use of 'add'
let l_eta_reduced : [Int -> Int] = [1,2].map(add)
                                         ^
repl.swift:3:6: note: found this candidate
func add(a: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
     ^
repl.swift:6:6: note: found this candidate
func add(_ a: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
     ^
```

Here the compiler is not able to choose the `add` function because the signatures are equivalent. 
As mentioned only the parameter name differs but it's not - and unfortunately cannot - be used when 
specifying the mapped function.

As a consequence the &eta;-reduction cannot be applied which invalidates the &eta;-conversion transformation 
rule since only &eta;-expansion is a valid rule.

## Redefinition in classes

In the previous sections we try to apply &eta;-conversion in presence of functions. So now lets try with function 
redefinitions in a class. For this purpose we define a basic class `MyInt`with two static `add` methods equivalent
to the previous ones.

```Swift
class MyInt {
  static func add(a:Int) -> (Int) -> Int { 
    return { b in a + b}
  }  
  static func add(_ a:Int) -> (Int) -> Int { 
    return { b in a + b}
  }
}
```

### Applying the &eta;-reduction again!

The previous integers list transformation can be transposed just adding a class prefix for the function selection.

```Swift
let l = [1,2].map{ b in MyInt.add(a:b) }
```

From this expression we can try to apply the &eta;-reduction once again.

```Swift
let l_eta_reduced : [(Int) -> Int] = [1,2].map(MyInt.add) 
```

 Once again the compiler complains raising the same error. 

```Swift
error: ambiguous use of 'add'
let l_eta_reduced : [(Int) -> Int] = [1,2].map(MyInt.add)
                                               ^
repl.swift:2:15: note: found this candidate
  static func add(a:Int) -> (Int) -> Int { 
              ^
repl.swift:5:15: note: found this candidate
  static func add(_ a:Int) -> (Int) -> Int { 
              ^
```

Fortunately we have the same result. Nevertheless unlike functions each class method 
can be expressed adding parameter names! The previous expression can be therefor more 
precise as shown in the next example.

```Swift
let l_eta_reduced = [1,2].map(MyInt.add(a:))
```

With this last approach we are able to distinguish two methods with the same profile
using parameter names involving the &eta;-reduction transformation rule. Then we can 
argue the &eta;-conversion is guarantee when we deal with methods in classes only!

## Expressiveness & Inconsistency

The argument naming convention came from Objective-C. This legacy has been applied 
for expressiveness purpose. For instance *delegates* in iOS use this capability when a 
method has the same semantic scope but with different contexts.

Unfortunately the reverse of the medal is the difficulty of the expressiveness when we 
want to apply all transformation rules - mainly the &eta;-conversion - when the code is 
designed using functionnal programming approach because code simplification can't be
applied everytime. 

Finally the expressiveness is not the same when we manipulate functions or static methods 
in a class. This implies an inconsistency in the design of this langage!

As a conclusion Swift is a young langage and we can hope this &eta;-conversion will be 
overcome enabling function qualification with parameter names. Hopefully such evolution 
does not imply backward incompatibilities.
